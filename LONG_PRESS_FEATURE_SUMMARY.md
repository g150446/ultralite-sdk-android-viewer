# Long Press Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a long press functionality to the ChaptersActivity that allows users to send content from a selected chapter to the end of the book to smart glasses display.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChaptersViewModel.java
**New Methods Added:**
- `sendChaptersFromIndexToEnd(List<ChapterItem> chapters, int startIndex)`: New public method to send chapters starting from a specific index to the end
- `startSendChaptersFromIndexThread()`: Private helper method to handle the thread creation for sending chapters from a specific starting point

**Modified Methods:**
- `startSendAllChaptersThread()`: Refactored to use the new `startSendChaptersFromIndexThread()` method
- `sendChaptersSequentially()`: Updated to start from the `currentChapterIndex` instead of always starting from 0
- `controlledObserver`: Updated to use the new thread method for consistency

**Key Features:**
- Maintains the same UI state management (sending status, progress tracking)
- Uses the same content loading and display logic as the existing "Send All" feature
- Properly handles the starting chapter index for sequential sending

### 2. ChaptersActivity.java
**New Import:**
- Added `android.widget.Toast` for user feedback

**New Methods Added:**
- `sendChaptersFromIndexToEnd(int startIndex)`: Handles the long press action and provides user feedback

**Modified Methods:**
- `onCreate()`: Added `setOnItemLongClickListener()` to the ListView to handle long press events

**Key Features:**
- Long press on any chapter item triggers sending from that chapter to the end
- Provides toast notification showing which chapter was selected and how many chapters will be sent
- Validates the selected index before proceeding
- Regular tap behavior (opening chapter detail) remains unchanged

## User Experience

### Existing Functionality (Unchanged)
- **Tap on chapter**: Opens the chapter detail view
- **"Send Content" menu**: Sends all chapters from beginning to end
- **"Stop" menu**: Stops the current sending operation

### New Functionality
- **Long press on chapter**: Sends content from the selected chapter to the end
- **Toast feedback**: Shows confirmation message like "Sending from 'Chapter 5' to end (8 chapters)"
- **Progress tracking**: Uses the same progress indicators as the full send feature

## Technical Details

### Threading Model
- Uses the same background threading approach as existing functionality
- Properly handles UI updates on the main thread
- Maintains the same error handling and interruption logic

### Content Processing
- Uses the same chapter content loading and parsing logic
- Maintains the same text chunking and display formatting
- Preserves the same pause intervals between chapters

### State Management
- Integrates with existing LiveData observers
- Uses the same sending status tracking
- Maintains consistency with the existing stop functionality

## Usage Instructions

1. **Long Press**: Long press on any chapter in the chapters list
2. **Confirmation**: A toast message will appear confirming the selection
3. **Progress**: The status bar will show current chapter being sent
4. **Stop**: Use the "Stop" menu item to cancel sending at any time

## Compatibility
- Maintains full backward compatibility
- No changes to existing APIs or menu functionality
- Works with existing ViewModel state management
- Compatible with current smart glasses display system
